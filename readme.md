# acid-state-dist

A replication backend for
[acid-state](http://github.com/acid-state/acid-state "acid-state").

Run an acid-state application on multiple nodes and have all instances operate
on the same state.
Two operation modes are provided:

 - **Regular operation**: without redundancy guarantees but fast,
 - **Redundant operation**: guarantees replication on _n_ nodes but slower.

Extented documentation is available via Haddock (/Hackage, as soon as released).
